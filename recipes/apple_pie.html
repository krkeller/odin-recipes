     <h3>Description:</h3>
     <p>No American recipe book is complete without Apple Pie. This classic dessert is a staple, and is one of my
          favorite things to bring to a party because, in my opinion, it's good hot, cold, and even room temperature. An
          apple pie is also stellar because with a bit of extra dough for shaping, you can easily have the most fancy
          pie at the party. I included just a standard pie top in this recipe, but feel free to get as fancy as you'd
          like with designs. </p>
     <p>As far as ingredients go, the original recipe included homemade pie dough, but I find store bought works
          perfectly well. Saves a bit of extra time as well. I also always go for Granny Smith apples - they are tarter
          in flavor and so are a good balance to all the cinnamon, sugar, and butter added to the filling. </p>

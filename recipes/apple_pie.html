     <h3>Description:</h3>
     <p>No American recipe book is complete without Apple Pie. This classic dessert is a staple, and is one of my
          favorite things to bring to a party because, in my opinion, it's good hot, cold, and even room temperature. An
          apple pie is also stellar because with a bit of extra dough for shaping, you can easily have the fanciest
          pie at the party. I included just a standard upper pie crust design in this recipe, but feel free to get as
          fancy as you'd
          like with designs. </p>
     <p>As far as ingredients go, the original recipe included homemade pie dough, but I find store bought works
          perfectly well. Saves a bit of extra time as well. I also always go for Granny Smith apples - they are more
          tart
          in flavor and so are a good balance to all the cinnamon, sugar, and butter added to the filling. </p>
     <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
     <ul>
          <li>Pre-Made pie crust</li>
          <li>2 1/2 pounds (about 6) apples, peeled, cored, sliced</li>
          <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
          <li>1/8 teaspoon ground clove</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>egg wash: beat 1 egg with 1 teaspoon water</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Steps:</h3>
     <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 375.</li>
          <li>In a bowl combine apples, sugar, cinnamon, cloves, lemon juice, zest, butter, flour. Let stand 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Roll out 1/2 of dough until 1/8 inch thick and fit into 9 inch pie plate. Trim off edge, but leave about
               1/2 inch overhang.</li>
          <li>Mound apple mixture into shell.</li>
          <li>Roll out remaining dough until 1/8 inch thick and drape over filling. Trim excess, leaving inch long
               overhang.</li>
          <li>Fold overhangs together and crimp edges with tines of a fork. Brush crust with egg wash and cut slits in
               top for steam vents.</li>
          <li>Bake for 1 hour. If needed, wrap the edges of the crust so it doesn't overcook.</li>
          <li>Cool pie and serve. Goes best with vanilla ice cream on the side.</li>
     </ol>

     <h3>Description:</h3>
     <p>This was the first dessert I was known for at my school - I would make it the night before, let it set
          overnight, and then the next day at school I'd be the most popular person around. This is also the first
          dessert that tested my patience. You're supposed to take it off the heat before mixing in the chocolate and
          marshmellows, so it doesn't get too runny. However, sometimes the mixture just wasn't hot enough to melt the
          ingredients, and my wooden mixing spoon gave me blisters everytime. Sometimes, instead of taking it off
          the heat entirely, I'd just transfer it to a new burner that's barely on - that way the ingredients melt into
          the mixture with a little less effort. It's a tricky situation at the end too - you want your final product to
          still be warm enough to be able to be easily transferred to the final container, but if it's too warm, it
          won't set as well in the middle. In the beginning, when first making this recipe, I'd set the fudge in a large
          baking pyrex. Then, after letting it set overnight, I'd cut it up and place it in my tins for transporting.
          However, a lot of the time, the middle would be more gooey, and also it would be a bit messy to eat. Because
          of that, I switched to using smaller cupcake tins with the cupcake linings. With this, the fudge sets much
          nicer and is already in bite-sized packaging for easy eating. Of course, you are welcome to use whichever
          container suits you best.

     <p>As far as toppings and additions go, it's pretty much unlimited. I first started by adding sprinkles on top, and
          then transitioned to M&M's, toffee chunks, and even peppermint shavings for the holiday season. I've never
          put additions into the fudge itself, but I did experiment once by adding last minute marshmellows - I
          didn't melt them all the way in order to have marshmellow chunks inside the fudge. It went interestingly...
          Other options would be various nuts, which I couldn't use because of family allergies, and the toppings I
          listed earlier.</p>

               dish, cupcake tins, etc.).</li>
          <li>Add any toppings, make sure to press gently into cooling fudge so the toppings stick a bit.</li>
